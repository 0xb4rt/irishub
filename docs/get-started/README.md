## What is IRISnet

IRIS Network (a.k.a. IRISnet) is named after Greek goddess **Iris**, said to be the personification of the rainbow and the faithful messenger between heaven and humanity. IRISnet aims to provide a foundation that facilitates construction of distributed business applications. IRIS Hub (a.k.a IRIShub), which is the centerpiece of IRISnet, introduces a unified service model that allows resources such as data services and computing services to be invoked across blockchains.
