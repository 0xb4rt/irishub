package subspace

/*
To prevent namespace collision between consumer app/v1, we define type
"space". A Space can only be generated by the keeper, and the keeper checks
the existence of the space having the same name before generating the
space.

Consumer app/v1 must take a space (via Keeper.Subspace), not the keeper
itself. This isolates each app/v1 from the others and make them modify the
parameters safely. Keeper can be treated as master permission for all
subspaces (via Keeper.GetSubspace), so should be passed to proper app/v1
(ex. gov)
